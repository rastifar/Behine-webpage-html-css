## Project Overview
This project was created as one of my exercises from a React.js bootcamp that I attended a few years ago.
The goal was to practise making a web page using HTML, CSS and make it responsive. 


### Technologies Used

•  HTML: For structuring the content of the web page.

•  CSS: For styling the web page to match the look and feel of the chosen online shop.
